Your README.md file is clear is concise at first glance. It gives detail into how users can download and open this project on their own devices which is great.I just have a few suggestions.

I would suggest explaining in more detail what your private homepage contains. For instance, does it include your skills, hobbies, resume, etc?


I would also include screenshots of your project in your README.md section as it could help the viewer have more of a visual understanding of your webpage.


Also on Instruction 4, there seems to be a miss-spelling. It is "youn" though I believe you meant "you".


Great work!
