Great that you were able to include some JavaScript into your project! I would suggest that in the future creating JavaScript code that creates change
to your website which your viewers can see rather than only in the console.

let name = "Jianwei Bi";
const msg = "Welcome to visit my homepage! Here you will find my basic info.";
function printPerson(name, msg){
	console.log(`Hello, this is ${name}.`);
	console.log(msg);
}
printPerson(name, msg);
